# Testing Spider City in Minecraft

Based on the code you've shared, here's how to test your Spider City build:

## Buttons to Try in Play Mode

1. **Chat Commands**:
   - Type `/Buildings` in chat - this will generate random skyscrapers using materials from your list
   - Type `/Grid` in chat - this will create a grid pattern on the ground

## Inventory to Collect Before Testing

Since your code uses specific blocks, you should have these in your inventory:

1. **Primary Building Materials**:
   - White stained glass
   - Stone
   - Log block (probably meant to be "log" or specific wood type)
   - Mossy cobblestone
   - Diamond block
   - Quartz block
   - Sea lantern
   - White glazed terracotta

2. **Additional Useful Items**:
   - A pickaxe (for any adjustments)
   - Building blocks for manual additions
   - Food for survival mode
   - Ender pearls or fireworks for quick movement around the large city

## Testing Tips

1. Start in Creative mode to avoid material limitations
2. Find a flat area or clear space before running the commands
3. The buildings will generate randomly with widths of 3-6 and heights of 20-50 blocks
4. The grid will create patterns at coordinates around (0,0,0)

The code includes teleport commands that will move you around (-20,0,0 and -100,0,20) so you can view the city from different angles.
